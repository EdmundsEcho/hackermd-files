# Notes from Edmund

Touching on both process and content.

Notes from the interview conducted by Jane (yaak) with Cameron

Topic: Rust governance

# Goal: Reflect an understanding of the situation

[x] record thoughts and ideas from the people involved

[x] useful, on point content

[x] active, constructive listening

[ ] WIP framework for capturing and socializing "so what's"

[ ] WIP communication plan

## Missing from the discussion

1. More concrete examples

   - Need more concrete examples of decisions and/or interactions, or outcomes that demonstrate the problem
     - Good: Alice proposing non-tech efforts that didn't go anywhere
     - Good: Unable to provide communications committee access to Twitter
     - Missing: Specific exchanges where the outcome was undesirable
     - Missing: People that left (good and bad)
     - etc.
   - Fodder to help evaluate ideas for strategies and tactics

2. Framework for guiding the discussion

   - Allow more deliberate choosing of how to spend time to help prioritize value and importance of free-flow
   - Something that more readily facilitates iteration on the "so what"
   - ... without preventing an open discussion of ideas

3. More consistent role of the interviewer

   - choose to have a point of view only to engage or clarify the person's point; acknowledge this may come from your own experience of the issue
     - avoid apologizing for injecting your POV
     - invite speaker to clarify if your POV is missing the point

4. The relationship between the Foundation and the core-team; scope of "who owns what", who is responsible for what.

# Discussion summary

Summary of interview intermixed with Edmund's synthesis.

## Witnessing the problem

Good for peeling the onion on ideas regarding causality.

- how good (nice people) can go bad (passive aggressive and other)
  
  - e.g., When people try to do the right by leaning-in to conflict, are villainized (misunderstanding of "best practice")

- Don't have sufficient and/or consistent "non-tech" skills; current skills in non-tech are too wide-ranging/incomplete (insufficient shared norms)

- Need more effort to coordinate and communicate (e.g., planning can take 30% of effort, non-technical lift is heavy)

- We are very white and male

- We look too inward for decision-making

- Not good at delegating authority and accountability

  - e.g., communications committee access to Rust's twitter

- Witnessing "paralysis by analysis" or due to "in-fighting" (accordingly, Alice's proposal did not go anywhere); avoiding potentially the most important decisions where people care a great deal

- Not making a decision leaves a void; precarious (open to "did it" versus "do it right")

- Fear of trusting fuelled by likely bad decision-making (Rust conference keynote speaker cancellation, copyright policy backlash from the community)

- Operating in an industry that may be prone to "distrust"(?)

## Source of power

While Rust was growing its capabilities to where we are now, the technical and collaborative skills were effective (they met the challenge). Going forward, points raised include:

- Need for common values beyond a commitment to technical skills
  (may be able to articulate the link between strong non-tech skills with better technical outcomes)
- Value more than just technical skills and people that like working on the compiler
- Governance RFC: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell tech what to do‚Äù. Why is it so tech so sacred?
- Why is it so important that tech teams are most in charge? (why axiomatic?)
- Is power too inward and nepotistic
- "people that do the most" dominate
- Ceding power to volunteers; a form of reciprocation or show respect for volunteer's efforts and time; augmented by empathy for avoidance of "being told what to do", and a general lack of respect for management (shared experience that "doesn't help")

## Context

- Getting into "volunteer's head", e.g., distrust of management
- Working with volunteers so are hesitant in how to manage
- Rust is maturing; no "low-hanging-fruit", solo contributions are more
  difficult to make

## Vision

Developing a vision for the next year

- Diversity: Need more
- Growth: Analyze why people "bounce off Rust"; a segmented view (not all
  "bounces" are a bad thing)
- Governance, learn and grow
- Setting expectations:
  - will be wrong, mistakes will be made (required to innovate and to be inclusive)
  - like a democracy, what we have and value is never a given but requires ongoing effort
  - thus the importance of fostering a culture of shared values and healthy, if not always placating/agreeable, relationships...

## Solutions

### Articulate vision and "what we value"

- What Rust community values and where (code, decision making process,
  Rust events, core-team, the Foundation etc.)

  - e.g., address value of non-technical skills impacting technical decisions

- Recognize and articulate how to have impact in Rust community

- Develop a vision that engages/channels new volunteers; drive towards impact and away from compiler

### Articulate challenges

- The community is white and male; need to prioritize diversity

- What is familiar is not working as well as needed: Augment number of choices (divert from bad habits) with training outside of technical skills e.g.,

  - trust is only needed for a "scoped worst case" e.g., if communications abuse the twitter account, revoke and tweet a mitigating message

  - discuss reason for being upset about a decision (even if technical reasons aren't fully fleshed-out); prioritize "earned the right to be heard", make it easier to ask for help in presenting a POV?

  - "leaning-in" to a point of disagreement is valued (provide concrete tactics for doing so, e.g., "safe word" :)), acknowledge emotions "are part of debate" And here are ways to channel for good)

- Need a process that recognizes/addresses inherent biases e.g.,

  - PR requests are likely to be included ("the doer's advantage")
  - person with strong tech skills likely to "win"

- Recognize inherent challenges (the problem itself, the people and resources); notwithstanding, tactics employed to mitigate (we do well articulating technical trade-offs, less so otherwise) e.g.,

  - How listen to everyone impacted by a decision when everyone is every user of Rust

    - mitigate: user survey as a means to record from people impacted by decisions made in Rust

  - Where it went wrong: Copyright

  - Technical core teams not wanting to be "told what to do"
    - mitigate: vision of Rust and need for input from wide-range, document how complex systems need more diverse input etc.

### Investments in culture

- Recruit diverse leadership
- Time and resources required to coordinate and prioritize
- Tools that enable more collaboration (e.g., Loomio)
- Training to broaden\* "shared-understanding" (seem to do ok on the technical side here, need more on non-technical, e.g. "best practice" to lean-in to disagreement, "emotions" are ok, but how to be constructive (on both sides))

üîñ Discourse and the like have badges that can include having completed
"training" for how to promote tactics that are likely to help get us all to
where we want to be. This would play well with public awareness of contributors
to the core lib and other important crates (per the Teal organization where decision makers need to recruit input from those with the relevant knowledge).

## Opportunity to learn more

1. Reasons for ‚Äúbouncing off Rust‚Äù

   Complete some sort of segmented understanding ("we can be everything to everyone")
   - for tech reason 
   - for unwelcoming reasons (diversity, cultural, governance)

2. Important review of events/decisions that "went bad"

   - Ideas for who to talk with next
   - Fodder for assessing new ideas

3. Study the `Advice Process` (and concrete use cases)
